-- Task #1
-- A popular candy store, with a number of regular customers of 1 million users,
-- turned to our company to create an online store.
-- You need to design a database for this store and code on SQL.
--
-- After communicating with the customer, it became clear that it would be necessary
-- to store information about Customer with the required fields: first name, last name, phone number, address, email, personal discount
--
-- Also store information about candies: name, type (chocolates, lollipops, gum), description, price and quantity.
--
-- And save the orders information to display in your personal account and collect data for analytics,
-- Order should contains customer information, the quantity and what kind of candy he ordered, order date.
-- HINT: one order can contain several different candies with a different quantity for each candy
--
-- The business analyst analyzed the market and calculated that the number of
-- various candies will be about a million with different names, the number of
-- each type of candy will be approximately the same. He also noticed that it will be
-- necessary to filter by type of candy, search by the name of the candy
-- (only search by the beginning of a word or by a complete match) and sort by price.
